# icewm
My configurations for IceWM window manager.

Using Linux Mint as a base, the config is made to work with standard tools from Mint.

There are some custom scripts included to mimic some configurations from i3.

This is meant for use in desktop, some funcionalities aren't tested in laptops (yet).
